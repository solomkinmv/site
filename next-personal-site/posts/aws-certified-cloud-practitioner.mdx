After dedicating more than a year to working with AWS, I set my sights on obtaining the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. However, during my preparation journey, I made an interesting strategic decision that proved to be quite beneficial: starting with the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification first.

While initially focused on the Solutions Architect certification, I realized after about a month of preparation that it might be advantageous to build a stronger foundation with something more fundamental. The Cloud Practitioner certification serves as an excellent entry point into AWS certifications, offering a broad overview of AWS services, fundamental cloud concepts, basic security and architectural principles, as well as cost and billing understanding.

## Study Resources and Preparation

My preparation strategy centered around two main resources from Udemy. For the main course material, I used ["Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 2025"](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new), which provided comprehensive coverage of exam topics with practical examples and demonstrations.

To test my knowledge, I relied on ["6 Practice Exams | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02"](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner). These practice tests proved invaluable in my preparation, offering realistic exam simulation with detailed explanations for each question. My scores consistently ranged between 75-85%, which helped build confidence and identify areas needing more attention.

## The Exam Experience

I decided to take the exam online from home. While some questions required careful consideration, most were straightforward if you had a solid understanding of the core concepts. I completed the exam in about 45 minutes out of the 90 available, and the end result exceeded my expectations: a perfect score of 1000/1000.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

For those considering this certification, I recommend focusing on understanding core AWS services and their use cases rather than just memorizing facts. The practice exams are crucial - not just for testing knowledge, but for understanding the exam format and question styles. Pay particular attention to the AWS well-architected framework principles and don't underestimate the importance of pricing and billing concepts.

With the Cloud Practitioner certification secured, I'm now better prepared to continue my journey toward the Solutions Architect certification. The foundational knowledge gained has provided a solid platform for tackling more complex AWS concepts.

## Conclusion

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to validate their AWS knowledge. While some might view it as too basic, I found it to be a valuable step in my certification journey. The perfect score was a welcome bonus, but the real value lies in the comprehensive understanding of AWS services and cloud concepts that this certification path provides.

For those considering AWS certifications, I highly recommend starting with the Cloud Practitioner, especially if you're new to AWS or cloud computing in general. It sets a strong foundation for more advanced certifications while providing valuable insights into AWS's vast ecosystem.
