Decided to move Shortcuts App to dedicated domain.

Purchased Domain on Namecheap.

Added domain to GitHub Pages using this guide: [Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages).

Configured domain to use GitHub Pages IP address: [Configuring an apex domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain)

After this I faced an issue with redirect from old domain to the new one using https. I had to use https://app.domain-forward.com/redirects/4c2feb08-fa9e-49a9-9f26-67ca6e7da9c7 to create a redirect from https://shortcus.solomk.in to https://hotkys.com.
