LeetCode offers a useful tree visualizer, yet it comes with several limitations that have consistently impacted my
experience. Firstly, it is not universally available across all problems, leading to frequent discussions like [this
one on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1966120/where-is-the-tree-visualizer-tool), with no
official clarification from the LeetCode team.

For example, the problem [105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/description/)
lacks tree visualizer support.

Additionally, the visualizer restricts node displays to no more than three symbols and fails to handle large trees.
An example input that demonstrates this limitation and results in a truncated display:
`[3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null,3,1,4,null,null,2,6,7,8,null,9,10,11,12,null,null]`

And finally, analyzing difference between actual and expected answers can be challenging.

## My Solution

After exploring various drawing libraries and finding none that met my criteria for compact drawing and multicolor
nodes, I decided to use canvas for manual drawing.

My solution can be found at https://solomk.in/leetcode-tree-visualizer.

Nice things about it:
* Manual input for trees in LeetCode format (with or without brackets)
* Compact drawing style
* Display of differences between actual and expected answers
* Support for long node text
* bigger trees support comparing to LeetCode native visualizer

Existing limitations:
* Can't collapse nodes
* No zoom
* Support for large trees is limited to browser window size

## Alternatives

For completeness, here are other notable options:

1. https://eniac00.github.io/btv/ — has nice UI, but has pretty much the same problems as LeetCode native tree visualizer
2. https://leetcode-tree-visualizer.vercel.app — similar to previous one
3. https://github.com/gaastonsr/treevis — console visualizer
