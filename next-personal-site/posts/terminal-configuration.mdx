I spent way too much time tweaking my terminal setup over the years. This is what I ended up with: syntax highlighting that catches typos before I hit enter, autosuggestions that complete commands from my history as I type, and fuzzy search to dig up that docker command I ran three months ago. The whole setup takes about 10 minutes.

## Quick Start

1. Install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) (optional but recommended)
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
3. Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for fuzzy finding
```sh
brew install fzf
```
4. Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
5. Install [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```
6. Install [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete)
```sh
git clone --depth 1 -- https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autocomplete
```
7. Install [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting.git \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/fast-syntax-highlighting
```
8. Add plugins to `~/.zshrc` (see [Configuration](#configuration)) and reload:
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Key Components

### Terminal Application

Terminal.app works, but lacks split panes and GPU acceleration. I use iTerm2, but there are other options depending on what you need:

- **[iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2)**: Split panes, search, extensive customization. What most Mac developers use.
- **[Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)**: Released late 2024, GPU-accelerated, very fast startup. New terminal, still lacks some features like ligatures.
- **[Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)**: GPU-accelerated, highly configurable via `kitty.conf`. Steeper learning curve.
- **[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)**: Minimal and fast. No tabs or splits - pair with tmux.

### Shell Framework: Oh My Zsh

[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) handles plugin loading and provides ~300 plugins out of the box. Instead of writing shell scripts, you add plugin names to an array in `~/.zshrc`.

If startup feels slow, [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) or [antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) offer lazy loading for faster shell init.

### Autocompletion Plugins

These two plugins do different things, and I use both:

- **[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)**: Shows gray text at your cursor with a suggestion from your history. Press right arrow to accept.
- **[zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete)**: Shows a dropdown menu below your prompt with possible completions. Navigate with arrows, press Tab to select.

You can use one or both depending on preference. I like having both since they complement each other.

- **[fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting)**: Highlights commands as you type. Valid commands turn green, typos turn red.

### History Search

Use `Ctrl+R` to trigger history search. With fzf installed and enabled through Oh My Zsh, you get a fuzzy finder for your command history that's much more powerful than the default search.

![fzf history search in action](https://armno.in.th/images/fzf-history/h-in-action.png)

### Themes

Themes control how your prompt looks but don't affect behavior. Oh My Zsh includes [many built-in themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes) configured via the `ZSH_THEME` variable in `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"  # minimal, fast
# ZSH_THEME="agnoster"    # shows git branch, needs Nerd Fonts
```

Some themes (like `agnoster`, `powerlevel10k`) require special fonts to display icons and symbols correctly. Install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to get these working:

```sh
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

Then set the font in your terminal app settings. If you see broken characters or squares in your prompt, you likely need to install and configure a Nerd Font.

For a cross-shell alternative, check out [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship), a fast, customizable prompt that works across different shells.

## Configuration

Here's a recommended Oh My Zsh plugins configuration for `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
plugins=(
    git                      # aliases: gst, gco, gp, gcmsg, etc.
    macos                    # ofd (open Finder), pfd (print Finder dir)
    zsh-autosuggestions      # gray text suggestions from history
    zsh-autocomplete         # dropdown completion menu
    fzf                      # fuzzy finder integration
    sudo                     # press Esc twice to add sudo
    colored-man-pages        # syntax highlighting in man pages
    history-substring-search # must be after zsh-autosuggestions
    fast-syntax-highlighting # must be last
    # Optional:
    # aws docker npm
)
```

**Performance tip:** Each plugin adds to your shell startup time. Only include plugins you actually use. If shell init feels slow, try removing some plugins.

### Extending PATH

To add directories to your PATH:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/bin
```

### Aliases and Functions

Shortcuts for frequently used commands. Add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
# Create directory and cd into it
mkcd() {
    mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}

# Quick navigation
alias ..="cd .."
alias ...="cd ../.."

# List files with details
alias ll="ls -la"

# Confirm before overwriting
alias cp="cp -i"
alias mv="mv -i"
alias rm="rm -i"

# Git shortcuts
alias gst="git status"
alias gp="git pull"
alias gc="git commit"
```

## Optional: Terminal Multiplexers

Use tmux or Zellij if you want session management and window splitting:

- **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)**: The classic choice. Powerful and widely used.
- **[Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij)**: Modern alternative to tmux with a more user-friendly interface.

Both let you split screens, manage workspaces, and keep sessions running after disconnection (useful for SSH - reconnect and your session is still there).

## Troubleshooting

### Slow shell startup

Too many plugins or a heavy theme can slow things down. Measure shell init time with:

```sh
time zsh -i -c exit
```

Anything under 0.5s is fine. If it's slower, remove unused plugins or switch to a lighter theme like `robbyrussell`.

### Plugins not loading

Check that the plugin exists in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/` and is spelled correctly in the plugins array.

### Autosuggestions not showing

Verify `zsh-autosuggestions` is in your plugins array. Some terminal color schemes make suggestions invisible. Try a different terminal or theme.

### Broken prompt or weird characters

Your theme likely requires Nerd Fonts. See [Themes section](#themes) for installation. Or switch to a simpler theme like `robbyrussell`.

### Command not found after PATH change

Changes to `~/.zshrc` require reloading. Run `source ~/.zshrc` or restart your terminal.

## Quick Reference: Keyboard Shortcuts

These work in ZSH and most other shells:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+A` | Move to beginning of line |
| `Ctrl+E` | Move to end of line |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear entire line |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete word before cursor |
| `Ctrl+R` | Search command history |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen (keeps scrollback) |
| `Cmd+K` | Clear screen and scrollback (iTerm2) |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete |
